This space contains all the Android apps that I have developed.

I started learning Android development recently from the Internet and a lot of the apps here are pretty basic. I wrote them to get a feel of and familiarize myself with the Android components. I am new to Java as well so that's another thing I have to get used to.

I am currently working on a couple of apps that are more involved and will upload them soon.
