This space contains all the Android apps that I have developed.

I started learning Android development recently from the Internet and a lot of the apps here are pretty basic. I wrote them to get a feel of and familiarize myself with the Android components. I am new to Java as well so that's another thing I have to get used to.

I am currently working on a couple of apps that are more involved and will upload them soon.

Description of the apps:
Audio			Plays one audio file each from internal memory (/res) and the SD card
BindService		Implements a bound service to add 2 numbers
HelloLifeCycle	Prints log statements to LogCat to show the various transitions between the states of an Activity
HelloWorld		Prints "Hello, World" when a button is clicked. Also my first Android app!
IntentService	Implements an Intent service which sleeps for a configurable number of seconds
ListView		Populates a ListView control from data in an ArrayAdapter and 'toasts' when a data element is touched
ListViewSQLite	Similar to ListView but populates data from an SQLite Database rather than an ArrayAdapter
SimpleService	Implements a normal service that calculates the average of user-entered numbers
TwoActivities	Project to understand the interactions when there are 2 activities in a project
Video			Plays a video from the SD card on the screen
SI Calculator	Implements a simple interest calculator (with a SeekBar control)
Traffic Lights	Implements a traffic light. The color appropriately changes when the respective light is touched

Please note that some of the projects were provided as shells in some tutorials that I used. But I added all of the functionality. This explains why you might see an Apache License in some of the projects.
