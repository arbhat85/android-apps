This repository contains all the Android apps that I have developed.

I started learning Android development recently from the Internet and a lot of
the apps here are pretty basic. I wrote them to get a feel of and familiarize
myself with the Android components. I am new to Java as well so that's another
thing I have to get used to.

I recently coded an app to implement a Jigsaw Puzzle and have uploaded the APK
file as well.

App Descriptions:
-----------------

1.  **Jigsaw Puzzle** Implements a jigsaw puzzle wherein the app breaks an image
    into multiple pieces and allows the user to put the pieces together by
    dragging and rotating them. The APK file is also uploaded.

2.  **Audio** Plays one audio file each from internal memory (/res) and the SD
    card

3.  **BindService** Implements a bound service to add 2 numbers

4.  **HelloLifeCycle**  Prints log statements to LogCat to show the various
    transitions between the states of an Activity

5.  **HelloWorld** Prints "Hello, World" when a button is clicked. Also my first
    Android app!

6.  **IntentService** Implements an Intent service which sleeps for a
    configurable number of seconds

7.  **ListView** Populates a ListView control from data in an ArrayAdapter and
    'toasts' when a data element is touched

8.  **ListViewSQLite** Similar to ListView but populates data from an SQLite
    Database rather than an ArrayAdapter

9.  **SI** **Calculator** Implements a simple interest calculator (with a
    SeekBar control)

10. **SimpleService** Implements a normal service that calculates the average of
    user-entered numbers

11. **Traffic** **Lights** Implements a traffic light. The color appropriately
    changes when the respective light is touched

12. **TwoActivities** Project to understand the interactions when there are 2
    activities in a project

13. **Video** Plays a video from the SD card on the screen

Please note that some of the projects were provided as shells in some tutorials
that I used. But I added all of the functionality. This explains why you might
see an Apache License in some of the projects.
